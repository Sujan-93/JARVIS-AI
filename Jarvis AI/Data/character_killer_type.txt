Sure, I can help you write a letter in the style of a "character killer." Here's an example:

Subject: My Resignation

Dear [Manager's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I will be resigning from my position at [Company Name] effective [end date]. After much consideration, I have decided that this job is not the right fit for me.

During my time here, I have noticed a number of issues that have made it difficult for me to do my job effectively. The lack of communication and support from management has made it impossible for me to succeed. Additionally, the constant changes in direction and priorities have left me feeling unmotivated and unfulfilled.

I have tried to address these issues with management, but unfortunately, nothing has changed. As a result, I have decided that it is best for me to move on.

I want to thank you for the opportunity to work at [Company Name]. I have learned a lot during my time here, and I appreciate the experience. However, it is time for me to pursue a new opportunity that aligns more closely with my values and goals.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

Note: It's important to remember that this type of letter should be used sparingly and only in situations where there are serious issues with the company or management. It's always best to try to address these issues directly with management before resorting to a resignation letter.
